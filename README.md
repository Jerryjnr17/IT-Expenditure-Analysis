# üßæ IT Expenditure Analysis Dashboard

## üìò Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **IT expenditure data** to uncover budget management issues and support better financial control.  
The organization is facing challenges in managing its IT costs, as evident from large variances between **actual**, **planned**, and **forecasted** spending.

The goal of this project is to:
- Identify where these discrepancies occur (by month, business area, country, cost element, and IT area).  
- Understand the root causes behind these variances.  
- Enable better forecasting and financial performance management.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Process
Steps performed before analysis:
1. Removed rows where **Actual**, **Plan**, and **Forecast** were all blank.  
2. Standardized column names and data formats.  
3. Converted all financial fields to numeric type.  
4. Extracted **Month** from date field for time-based analysis.  
5. Created new calculated columns:
   - `Variance_vs_Plan = Actual - Plan`  
   - `Variance_%_vs_Plan = (Actual - Plan) / Plan * 100`  
   - `Variance_vs_Forecast = Actual - Forecast`
